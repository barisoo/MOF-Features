# MOF-Features
The files allow extraction of features from cif files of metal organic frameworks. Typicvally these extracted features would be using in machine learning models to predict various properties of MOFs, such as O2 and N2 uptake, and the diffusion of O2 and N2. 

-A jupyter notebook is included to give better context to the code. 

-A python  file is also included which would act as a simple module for using the defined functions in other projects.
